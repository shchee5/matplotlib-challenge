# matplotlib-challenge

## Description
The executive team of Pymaceuticals would like a report of tables and figures that provide results on performance of Capomulin, our drug of interest, compared to other treatment regimens on mice with SCC tumor growth.

## How to Run Code
Clone this repository and run code under the pymaceuticals_main Jupyter notebook.

## Results
Below are three insights drawn from the provided dataset:
    1. The upper quartile for final tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin (40.2 mm3) was lower than the other drugs of interest (Ramicane: 40.7 mm3, Infubinol: 65.5 mm3, Ceftamin: 64.3 mm3). This suggests that the Capomulin drug was more effective in treating the tumor than the other drugs.
    2. Results for one of the mice treated with Capomulin suggests that the treatment may take some time before a decrease in tumor size is observed (for mouse l509, tumor volume decreased after around 20 days after treatment began).
    3. The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84, which suggests that the two variables have strong relationship with each other (e.g. higher weight will likely result in higher average tumor volume).
